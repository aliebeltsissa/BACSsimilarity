Notes: BACS similarity experiment

	- in English? Would reach slightly different participant set as affix experiment, but they're separate so it doesn't matter? (also, don't want people to take this one before the affix experiment - but can launch it afterwards)
	- welcome message works online?
	- consent form suitable for online?
	- is it worth including all BACS1 characters to widen the scope of the study? (already giving participants more characters than are actually used in the study)
	- exclude participants who don't respond 1 to identical characters

Chetail et al.
	- 1152 trials per participant
	- familiarisation w/ hand-copying -> given whole set to examine for 45s
