Notes: BACS similarity experiment

	- in English? Would reach slightly different participant set as affix experiment, but they're separate so it doesn't matter? (also, don't want people to take this one before the affix experiment - but can launch it afterwards)
	- welcome message works online?
	- consent form suitable for online?
	- is it worth including all BACS1 characters to widen the scope of the study? (already giving participants more characters than are actually used in the study)
	- exclude participants who don't respond 1 to identical characters
	- could actually stay with 1 repo instead of BASCS1SE part 1 & 2: run part 1, un-comment code for part 2, run that

Fatigue
	- currently 50min long
	- worth splitting into 4 parts instead of 2?
		wouldn't cost us any extra money
		but we said in 2 parts in the ethics application
		but 4 parts would make it even easier on participants
	- maybe make it more engaging?
		add different colours for the characters/instructions for each block?
		add in instruction that it's long and monotonous, but to please keep paying attention?
